The past few weeks of `vibe coding` and AI tools has slowed my own ability to write code,
pausing for the moment for autofill to write the code that I double check.

This however is great, as its like rekindling my joy for programming, it wasn't just about the results,
but it was also about the bugs we made along the way :)

I have never written SO MANY DETAILED COMMENTS, but no AI, so, every... single... word... of documentation is made by me.

But jokes aside, its still a useful skill to practice in case someone wants to actually use my code library
