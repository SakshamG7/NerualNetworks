The past few weeks of `vibe coding` and AI tools has slowed my own ability to write code,
pausing for the moment for autofill to write the code that I double-check.

This however is great, as its like rekindling my joy for programming, it wasn't just about the results,
but it was also about the bugs we made along the way :)

I have never written SO MANY DETAILED COMMENTS,
but with no AI, so, every... single... word... of documentation is made by me.

But jokes aside, It's still a useful skill to practice in case someone wants to actually use my code library.

Relearning the implementation of matrix multiplication was a shock, of course I can easily do it by hand,
but the real issue is with efficiently implementing it. This would be the most used function in the whole project,
so every little second literally counts!
